# Wk8-MySQL
Week 8 Coding Assignment
We are in the process of creating an application that will perform CRUD operations
on a MySQL database. In week 1, we wrote code to connect to a MySQL database using JDBC API. 
This week, we diagrammed the data base tables using Draw.io to create an entity-relationship
diagram using crows' foot notation. We also wrote SQL statements and DBeaver to create the tables.
